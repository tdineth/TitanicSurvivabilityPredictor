# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

## Overview  
This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict the survival probability of Titanic passengers based on historical data. Using a range of passenger attributes such as age, sex, ticket class, and family relationships, the model aims to estimate whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

### Objective  
This project demonstrates the application of **Linear Regression** for binary classification by predicting survival probability (scaled between 0 and 1) using structured tabular data.

## ðŸ“Œ Important Note  
This is a **followed and recreated project** based on publicly available datasets and concepts for personal learning and educational purposes.  
It is not an original research contribution but rather a hands-on exercise to strengthen practical understanding of machine learning pipelines, data preprocessing, and regression modeling.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution Context  
After the Titanic disaster, families and government authorities faced the heartbreaking task of identifying survivors and lost individuals. One practical approach to assist in this process could have been using data-driven predictions. If the personal details of a missing passenger â€” such as age, gender, class, and travel companions â€” were known, a model like this could have helped estimate the likelihood of their survival.

In this project, I trained a machine learning model using historically accurate records. By inputting the details of a lost or unidentified passenger, the model can predict the probability of survival. While this is a modern exercise applied to historical data, it demonstrates how machine learning could be used to support decision-making in real-world crisis situations.
