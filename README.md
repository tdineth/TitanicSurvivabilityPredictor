# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

## Overview
This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict the survival probability of Titanic passengers based on historical data. Using a range of passenger attributes such as age, sex, ticket class, and family relationships, the model aims to estimate whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

### Objective
This project demonstrates the application of **Linear Regression** for binary classification by predicting survival probability (scaled between 0 and 1) using structured tabular data.

## ðŸ“Œ Important Note
This is a **followed and recreated project** based on publicly available datasets and concepts for personal learning and educational purposes.  
It is not an original research contribution but rather a hands-on exercise to strengthen practical understanding of machine learning pipelines, data preprocessing, and regression modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from **TensorFlowâ€™s public Titanic dataset**, which is hosted on Google Cloud Storage.
